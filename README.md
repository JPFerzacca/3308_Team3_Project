### Weekly Meeting: Thursdays at 7pm MST 

## Vision statement: 
Provide busy customers with easy to access recipes using ingredients they have at home.

## Motivation: 
We all love to cook and this would be a product we would love to use ourselves!

## Risks to project completion, possibly including:
new language or working environment /n
no prior experience working with these team members
lack of front and backend experience, git experience, SQL experience or building applications
teammates in different time zones
Scope creep
Due to lack of experience building applications, there is a risk of missizing user stories and falling behind in completing tasks.

### Mitigation Strategy for above risks
don't bite off more than we can chew
using available and outside resources to help determine timelines 
allocate time for research to help with sizing user stories
overall: be realistic with sizing stories and requirements
Maintain regular communication with teammates
potential to implement demos
teammates switching roles to avoid silos or not knowing pieces of the project

## Development method: (need more specifics)
scrum method and jira for the tracking software
Will use discord for team coordination and communication.
